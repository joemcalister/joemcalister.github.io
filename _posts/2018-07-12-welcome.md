Hey, this has been a long time coming. thoughts.joe.ac is my new blog where I can ramble about the current work that I'm developing, things I find funny/odd/maddening and go into a bit more detail in regards to the parts of my work that people keep asking about. It won't be consistant posts about technology, but that's probably how I'll kick it off.

Also, I'm happy to announce that I'm the newest fellow at Near Now! It's an honour to join the list of awe-inspiring past fellows, many of which are long-time inspirations of mine, as I plan and begin work on exciting projects coming up over the next 12 months. It's an amazing opportunity for me and I'm looking forward to finally being able to create work I've been planning for years now.

To kick off my fellowship there's a retrospective of some of my prior works <b>"Two people on the road."</b> 7th September  -  15th September 2018 at Broadway, Nottingham where you can meet me, but also see works that you might have missed in the past, as well as some improved favourites!
